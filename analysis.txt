Discussion:

Over all three experiments, the training loss decreases with each epoch, and the BLEU score increases.
In training, the model with single-headed attention outperforms the model with multi-headed attention with a small margin, and the model
without attention by a significant margin in terms of the BLEU score. Out of all three models, the model without attention had the highest loss
after finishing 5 epochs. In testing, the model with multi-headed attention outperformed the model with single-headed attention by a slight margin,
and without attention again with a significant margin.

Although it is typically expected that the training BLEU score would be equal or better than the testing BLEU score, I noticed that in my experiments,
the testing BLEU scores were higher than the training BLEU scores. Testing makes use of beam search, while training uses strategies like teacher forcing that potentially lead
to exposure bias, and a lower BLEU scores.

Taking into consideration both the BLEU score and loss, the multi-headed attention model and single-headed attention model outperform the model without attention. This
is expected given the benefits of using attention, which involve having access to the entire input sequence can can pick elements from the input sequence to produce the output.
Both multi-headed and single-headed outperformed each other in one metric or another. In training, multi-headed model has a slightly better BLEU score, but single-headed model has
a lower loss. In testing, multi-headed model outperforms the single-headed model. In theory multi-headed attention model should perform better as it can encode multiple relationships 
and acquire richer interpretations for words and sequences. This could be because of lack of overfitting on the training set, and good generalization on the unseen test set.
